Dragon Village Crisis Scenario:
The peaceful village of Eldermere has been terrorized by a young dragon that has taken up residence in the nearby mountains. The villagers are desperate for help, but the dragon seems to be acting out of fear rather than malice. Players must investigate the situation and decide how to resolve the conflict.

Possible Approaches:
- Diplomatic: Try to communicate with the dragon and find a peaceful solution
- Aggressive: Hunt down and slay the dragon to protect the village
- Investigative: Discover why the dragon came to the area and address the root cause
- Protective: Help the villagers evacuate and find a new home

This scenario demonstrates how multiple valid approaches can lead to different story outcomes and character development opportunities.
